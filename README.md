# Module 3 Challenge

## Description

Welcome to my portfolio! This project was developed as part of a bootcamp assignment to create a professional portfolio that caters to the needs of hiring front-end developers. My motivation for creating this portfolio was driven by the desire to establish a strong online presence and showcase my skills and projects to potential employers. Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable experience in creating a responsive and visually appealing web design. I enhanced my understanding of HTML andCSS to implement smooth navigation, responsive layouts, and interactive features.
